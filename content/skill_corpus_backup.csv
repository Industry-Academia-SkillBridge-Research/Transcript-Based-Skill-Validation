"Hypothesis Testing","lecture_note","IT3011_Notes","Hypothesis testing is a statistical procedure used to decide whether there is enough evidence in a sample to support a claim about a population parameter. It involves null and alternative hypotheses, test statistics, significance levels, and p-values."
"Data Structures & Algorithms","module_outline","IT2070_Outline","Data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues and trees are used to organise data efficiently. Algorithms such as searching and sorting operate on these structures, and their performance is analysed using asymptotic notations like Big-O."
"SQL & Relational Databases","module_outline","IT2040_DBMS","Relational databases store data in tables with rows and columns. SQL is used to define tables, insert and update data, and query it using SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY and aggregate functions to answer business questions."
"Machine Learning Foundations","module_outline","IT3071_ML","Machine learning focuses on learning patterns from data using models such as linear regression, decision trees and neural networks. Datasets are split into training and testing sets, and models are evaluated with metrics such as accuracy and mean squared error."
